KAN vs. ANN: A Comparative Study for Protein and Succinylation Prediction
Overview
This project explores the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and compares it to a traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for protein structure prediction and succinylation site prediction. The research focuses on understanding the differences in model performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

🔍 Key Objectives
Compare KAN and ANN architectures for biological sequence prediction.
Evaluate model accuracy, generalization, and efficiency on protein datasets.
Analyze feature importance and interpretability between both models.
Assess real-world applications in bioinformatics and computational biology.
🏗️ Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Protein sequence data was collected and formatted.
Model Training:
KAN and ANN models were trained using the same dataset.
Hyperparameters were optimized for fair comparison.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision were evaluated.
Interpretability Analysis: Feature importance was analyzed for both models.
📊 Results & Findings
KAN offers greater interpretability due to its functional decomposition approach.
ANN shows better generalization for large datasets but is computationally intensive.
KAN can outperform ANN in specific cases, especially with limited data.
